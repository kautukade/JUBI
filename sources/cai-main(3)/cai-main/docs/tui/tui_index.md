# CAI Terminal User Interface (TUI)

!!! warning "Documentation freshness"
    This TUI section is **likely out of date**. **Maintained documentation** for commands and behaviour lives under the **[CLI docs](../cai/getting-started/commands.md)** and the rest of the **`docs/cai/`** tree; prefer those sources when something disagrees with this guide.

> **⚠️ DEPRECATED - Superseded by Mobile UI**  
> The Terminal User Interface (TUI) has been deprecated in favor of the new **[Mobile UI](../mui/mui_index.md)** for CAI-Pro users.  
> While the TUI remains functional for existing users, all new features and development efforts are focused on the Mobile UI.

The CAI TUI provides a modern, terminal-based interface for interacting with CAI agents, enabling powerful multi-agent workflows, parallel execution, and advanced security testing capabilities.

## Overview

The TUI is built on [Textual](https://textual.textualize.io/), offering:

- **🖥️ Multi-Terminal Support**: Work with up to 4 agents simultaneously in split-screen layouts
- **👥 Preconfigured Teams**: One-click deployment of specialized agent teams for security assessments
- **⚡ Parallel Execution**: Execute multiple agents in parallel with independent conversations
- **📊 Real-Time Stats**: Monitor costs, tokens, and agent performance
- **🎯 Smart Agent Selection**: Built-in agent recommendation system
- **🔧 MCP Integration**: Connect to external tools via Model Context Protocol
- **💾 Session Management**: Save and restore conversations across sessions

## When to Use the TUI vs CLI

| Feature | TUI | CLI |
|---------|-----|-----|
| **Visual feedback** | ✅ Rich UI with colors and layouts | ⚠️ Basic text output |
| **Multi-agent workflows** | ✅ Visual split-screen | ❌ Sequential only |
| **Agent teams** | ✅ One-click preconfigured teams | ❌ Manual setup |
| **Real-time monitoring** | ✅ Stats sidebar | ⚠️ Limited |
| **Session management** | ✅ Visual queue and history | ⚠️ Command-based |
| **Scripting/Automation** | ❌ Interactive only | ✅ Full scripting support |
| **Resource usage** | ⚠️ Higher (UI overhead) | ✅ Minimal |

**Use TUI for**: Interactive security testing, bug bounty hunting, team-based analysis, exploratory testing

**Use CLI for**: Automation, scripting, CI/CD integration, headless environments

## Quick Start

Launch the TUI:

```bash
cai --tui
```

Basic workflow:

1. Configure your `ALIAS_API_KEY` in **Sidebar → Keys**
2. Select a model (recommended: `alias1`) from the terminal header dropdown
3. Choose an agent or use `selection_agent` for recommendations
4. Type your prompt and press **Enter**

See the [Getting Started Guide](getting_started.md) for detailed instructions.

## System Requirements

- **Python**: 3.9 or higher
- **Terminal**: Modern terminal with 256+ color support
- **Minimum window size**: 120x40 characters (recommended)
- **API Key**: Valid `ALIAS_API_KEY` (get one from [Alias Robotics](https://aliasrobotics.com))

### Supported Terminals

- ✅ iTerm2 (macOS)
- ✅ Terminal.app (macOS)
- ✅ GNOME Terminal (Linux)
- ✅ Konsole (Linux)
- ✅ Windows Terminal (Windows)
- ✅ Alacritty (all platforms)
- ⚠️ tmux/screen (limited color support)

## Key Features

### 🖥️ Multiple Terminals

Work with multiple agents simultaneously in responsive layouts:

- **1 terminal**: Full-screen mode
- **2 terminals**: Horizontal split
- **3 terminals**: 2+1 grid layout
- **4+ terminals**: 2x2 grid with scroll

Each terminal maintains its own:
- Independent agent and model selection
- Isolated conversation history
- Separate execution context

### 👥 Preconfigured Teams

Access specialized agent teams from the sidebar:

- **Team: 2 Red + 2 Bug**: Offensive testing + bug hunting
- **Team: 2 Red + 2 Blue**: Dual-perspective security analysis
- **Team: Red + Blue + Retester + Bug**: Comprehensive assessment workflow

Learn more: [Teams and Parallel Execution](teams_and_parallel_execution.md)

### 🎯 Smart Agent Selection

Use the `selection_agent` to get intelligent agent recommendations based on your task:

```
/agent selection_agent
```

Or simply select it from the agent dropdown.

### 📊 Sidebar Features

The collapsible sidebar (`Ctrl+S`) provides:

- **Teams**: One-click team deployment
- **Queue**: Visual prompt queue management
- **Stats**: Real-time session statistics and costs
- **Keys**: Manage API keys for multiple providers
